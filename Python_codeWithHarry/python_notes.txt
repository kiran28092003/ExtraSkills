Day 10 - Taking User Input in python
In python, we can take user input directly by using input() function.This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable

Syntax:
variable=input()
But input function returns the value as string. Hence we have to typecast them whenever required to another datatype.

Example:
variable=int(input())
variable=float(input())
We can also display a text using input function. This will make input() function take user input and display a message as well

Example:
a=input("Enter the name: ")
print(a)
Output:
Enter the name: Harry
Harry

Day 5 - Comments, Escape sequence & Print in Python
Welcome to Day 5 of 100DaysOfCode. Today we will talk about Comments, Escape Sequences and little bit more about print statement in Python. We will also throw some light on Escape Sequences

Python Comments
A comment is a part of the coding file that the programmer does not want to execute, rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing.

Single-Line Comments:
To write a comment just add a ‘#’ at the start of the line.

Example 1
#This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
print("This is a print statement.")
Output:

This is a print statement.
Example 2
print("Hello World !!!") #Printing Hello World
Output:

Hello World !!!
Example 3:
print("Python Program")
#print("Python Program")
Output:
Python Program
Multi-Line Comments:
To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.

Example 1: The use of ‘#’.

#It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
#If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code.
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
Output:

p is greater than 5.
Example 2: The use of multiline string.

"""This is an if-else statement.
It will execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
If the condition is false then it will execute another block of code."""
p = 7
if (p > 5):
    print("p is greater than 5.")
else:
    print("p is not greater than 5.")
Output
p is greater than 5.
Escape Sequence Characters
To insert characters that cannot be directly used in a string, we use an escape sequence character.

An escape sequence character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of a character that cannot be directly used in a string is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

print("This doesnt "execute")
print("This will \" execute")
More on Print statement
The syntax of a print statement looks something like this:

print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)
Other Parameters of Print Statement
object(s): Any object, and as many as you like. Will be converted to string before printed
sep='separator': Specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one. Default is ' '
end='end': Specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed)
file: An object with a write method. Default is sys.stdout
Parameters 2 to 4 are optional
**********************************************************************

Day 6 - Variables and Data Types
What is a variable?
Variable is like a container that holds data. Very similar to how our containers in kitchen holds sugar, salt etc Creating a variable is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some value. In Python its as easy as writing:

a = 1
b = True
c = "Harry"
d = None
These are four variables of different data types.

What is a Data Type?
Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.
In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:

a = 1
print(type(a))
b = "1"
print(type(b))
By default, python provides the following built-in data types:
***************************************************************
1. Numeric data: int, float, complex
int: 3, -8, 0
float: 7.349, -9.0, 0.0000001
complex: 6 + 2i
***************************************************************
2. Text data: str
str: "Hello World!!!", "Python Programming"
***************************************************************
3. Boolean data:
Boolean data consists of values True or False.
**************************************************************
4. Sequenced data: list, tuple
list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.
**************************************************************
Example:

list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]
print(list1)
Output:

[8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ['apple', 'banana']]
Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation.

Example:

tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
print(tuple1)
Output:

(('parrot', 'sparrow'), ('Lion', 'Tiger'))
5. Mapped data: dict
dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.

Example:

dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True}
print(dict1)
Output:

{'name': 'Sakshi', 'age': 20, 'canVote': True}


Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

Arithmetic operators
Operator	Operator Name	Example
+	Addition	15+7
-	Subtraction	15-7
*	Multiplication	5*7
**	Exponential	5**3
/	Division	5/3
%	Modulus	15%7
//	Floor Division	15//7
Exercise
n = 15
m = 7
ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)
ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)
ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)
ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)
ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)
ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
Explaination
Here 'n' and 'm' are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables 'ans1' , 'ans2' ,'ans3', 'ans4','ans5' and 'ans6' contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.

*************************************************************************************************88
Typecasting in python
The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.

Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the type casting in python.

Two Types of Typecasting:
Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python)
Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python).
Explicit typecasting:
The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer or programmer's intervention or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit type conversion.

It can be achieved with the help of Python’s built-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), hex(), oct(), str(), etc .

Example of explicit typecasting:
string = "15"
number = 7
string_number = int(string) #throws an error if the string is not a valid integer
sum= number + string_number
print("The Sum of both the numbers is: ", sum)
Output:
The Sum of both the numbers is 22
Implicit type casting:
Data types in Python do not have the same level i.e. ordering of data types is not the same in Python. Some of the data types have higher-order, and some have lower order. While performing any operations on variables with different data types in Python, one of the variable's data types will be changed to the higher data type. According to the level, one data type is converted into other by the Python interpreter itself (automatically). This is called, implicit typecasting in python.

Python converts a smaller data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss.

Example of implicit type casting:
# Python automatically converts
# a to int
a = 7
print(type(a))
 
# Python automatically converts b to float
b = 3.0
print(type(b))
 
# Python automatically converts c to float as it is a float addition
c = a + b
print(c)
print(type(c))
Ouput:
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
10.0
<class 'float'>

*****************************************************************************
What are strings?
In python, anything that you enclose between single or double quotation marks is considered a string. A string is essentially a sequence or array of textual data. Strings are used when working with Unicode characters.

Example
name = "Harry"
print("Hello, " + name)
Output
Hello, Harry

Note: It does not matter whether you enclose your strings in single or double quotes, the output remains the same.

Sometimes, the user might need to put quotation marks in between the strings. Example, consider the sentence: He said, “I want to eat an apple”.

How will you print this statement in python?: He said, "I want to eat an apple". We will definitely use single quotes for our convenience

print('He said, "I want to eat an apple".')
Multiline Strings
If our string has multiple lines, we can create them like this:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
Accessing Characters of a String
In Python, string is like an array of characters. We can access parts of string by using its index which starts from 0.
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

print(name[0])
print(name[1])
Looping through the string
We can loop through strings using a for loop like this:

for character in name:
    print(character)
Above code prints all the characters in the string name one by one!
*********************************************************************
Day-14

String Slicing & Operations on String
Length of a String
We can find the length of a string using len() function.

Example:
fruit = "Mango"
len1 = len(fruit)
print("Mango is a", len1, "letter word.")
Output:
Mango is a 5 letter word.

String as an array
A string is essentially a sequence of characters also called an array. Thus we can access the elements of this array.

Example:
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])
print(pie[6])	#returns character at specified index
Output:
Apple
i
Note: This method of specifying the start and end index to specify a part of a string is called slicing.

Slicing Example:
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])      #Slicing from Start
print(pie[5:])      #Slicing till End
print(pie[2:6])     #Slicing in between
print(pie[-8:])     #Slicing using negative index
Output:
Apple
Pie
pleP
ApplePie
Loop through a String:
Strings are arrays and arrays are iterable. Thus we can loop through strings.

Example:
alphabets = "ABCDE"
for i in alphabets:
    print(i)
Output:
A
B
C
D
E

nm = "Harry"
print(nm[-4:-2])  => H   a   r   r   y
		     0   1   2   3   4   (Forward indexing)
		    -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   (Backward indexing)
*********************************************************************
Day-13
String methods
Python provides a set of built-in methods that we can use to alter and modify the strings.

upper() :
The upper() method converts a string to upper case.

Example:
str1 = "AbcDEfghIJ"
print(str1.upper())
Output:
ABCDEFGHIJ
lower()
The lower() method converts a string to lower case.

Example:
str1 = "AbcDEfghIJ"
print(str1.lower())
Output:
abcdefghij
strip() :
The strip() method removes any white spaces before and after the string.

Example:
str2 = " Silver Spoon "
print(str2.strip)
Output:
Silver Spoon
rstrip() :
the rstrip() removes any trailing characters. Example:

str3 = "Hello !!!"
print(str3.rstrip("!"))
Output:
Hello
replace() :
The replace() method replaces all occurences of a string with another string. Example:

str2 = "Silver Spoon"
print(str2.replace("Sp", "M"))
Output:
Silver Moon
split() :
The split() method splits the given string at the specified instance and returns the separated strings as list items.

Example:
str2 = "Silver Spoon"
print(str2.split(" "))      #Splits the string at the whitespace " ".
Output:
['Silver', 'Spoon']
There are various other string methods that we can use to modify our strings.
capitalize() :
The capitalize() method turns only the first character of the string to uppercase and the rest other characters of the string are turned to lowercase. The string has no effect if the first character is already uppercase.

Example:
str1 = "hello"
capStr1 = str1.capitalize()
print(capStr1)
str2 = "hello WorlD"
capStr2 = str2.capitalize()
print(capStr2)
Output:
Hello
Hello world
center() :
The center() method aligns the string to the center as per the parameters given by the user.

Example:
str1 = "Welcome to the Console!!!"
print(str1.center(50))
Output:
            Welcome to the Console!!!
We can also provide padding character. It will fill the rest of the fill characters provided by the user.

Example:
str1 = "Welcome to the Console!!!"
print(str1.center(50, "."))
Output:
............Welcome to the Console!!!.............
count() :
The count() method returns the number of times the given value has occurred within the given string.

Example:
str2 = "Abracadabra"
countStr = str2.count("a")
print(countStr)
Output:
4
endswith() :
The endswith() method checks if the string ends with a given value. If yes then return True, else return False.

Example :
str1 = "Welcome to the Console !!!"
print(str1.endswith("!!!"))
Output:
True
We can even also check for a value in-between the string by providing start and end index positions.

Example:
str1 = "Welcome to the Console !!!"
print(str1.endswith("to", 4, 10))
Output:
True
find() :
The find() method searches for the first occurrence of the given value and returns the index where it is present. If given value is absent from the string then return -1.

Example:
str1 = "He's name is Dan. He is an honest man."
print(str1.find("is"))
Output:
10
As we can see, this method is somewhat similar to the index() method. The major difference being that index() raises an exception if value is absent whereas find() does not.

Example:
str1 = "He's name is Dan. He is an honest man."
print(str1.find("Daniel"))
Output:
-1
index() :
The index() method searches for the first occurrence of the given value and returns the index where it is present. If given value is absent from the string then raise an exception.

Example:
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.index("Dan"))
Output:
13
As we can see, this method is somewhat similar to the find() method. The major difference being that index() raises an exception if value is absent whereas find() does not.

Example:
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.index("Daniel"))
Output:
ValueError: substring not found
isalnum() :
The isalnum() method returns True only if the entire string only consists of A-Z, a-z, 0-9. If any other characters or punctuations are present, then it returns False.

Example 1:
str1 = "WelcomeToTheConsole"
print(str1.isalnum())
Output:

True
isalpha() :
The isalnum() method returns True only if the entire string only consists of A-Z, a-z. If any other characters or punctuations or numbers(0-9) are present, then it returns False.

Example :
str1 = "Welcome"
print(str1.isalpha())
Output:
True
islower() :
The islower() method returns True if all the characters in the string are lower case, else it returns False.

Example:
str1 = "hello world"
print(str1.islower())
Output:
True
isprintable() :
The isprintable() method returns True if all the values within the given string are printable, if not, then return False.

Example :
str1 = "We wish you a Merry Christmas"
print(str1.isprintable())
Output:
True
isspace() :
The isspace() method returns True only and only if the string contains white spaces, else returns False.

Example:
str1 = "        "       #using Spacebar
print(str1.isspace())
str2 = "        "       #using Tab
print(str2.isspace())
Output:
True
True
istitle() :
The istitile() returns True only if the first letter of each word of the string is capitalized, else it returns False.

Example:
str1 = "World Health Organization" 
print(str1.istitle())
Output:
True
Example:
str2 = "To kill a Mocking bird"
print(str2.istitle())
Output:
False
isupper() :
The isupper() method returns True if all the characters in the string are upper case, else it returns False.

Example :
str1 = "WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION" 
print(str1.isupper())
Output:
True
startswith() :
The endswith() method checks if the string starts with a given value. If yes then return True, else return False.

Example :
str1 = "Python is a Interpreted Language" 
print(str1.startswith("Python"))
Output:
True
swapcase() :
The swapcase() method changes the character casing of the string. Upper case are converted to lower case and lower case to upper case.

Example:
str1 = "Python is a Interpreted Language" 
print(str1.swapcase())
Output:
pYTHON IS A iNTERPRETED lANGUAGE
title() :
The title() method capitalizes each letter of the word within the string.

Example:
str1 = "He's name is Dan. Dan is an honest man."
print(str1.title())
Output:
He'S Name Is Dan. Dan Is An Honest Man.
*********************************************************************
Day-15

if the expression evaluates False:
Execute the block of code inside else statement. After execution return to the code out of the if……else block.

Example:
applePrice = 210
budget = 200
if (applePrice <= budget):
    print("Alexa, add 1 kg Apples to the cart.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.")
Output:
Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.

elif Statements
Sometimes, the programmer may want to evaluate more than one condition, this can be done using an elif statement.

Working of an elif statement
Execute the block of code inside if statement if the initial expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

Execute the block of code inside the first elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

Execute the block of code inside the second elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.
.
.
.
Execute the block of code inside the nth elif statement if the expression inside it evaluates True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

Execute the block of code inside else statement if none of the expression evaluates to True. After execution return to the code out of the if block.

Example:
num = 0
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num == 0):
    print("Number is Zero.")
else:
    print("Number is positive.")
Output:
Number is Zero.

Nested if statements
We can use if, if-else, elif statements inside other if statements as well.
Example:

num = 18
if (num < 0):
    print("Number is negative.")
elif (num > 0):
    if (num <= 10):
        print("Number is between 1-10")
    elif (num > 10 and num <= 20):
        print("Number is between 11-20")
    else:
        print("Number is greater than 20")
else:
    print("Number is zero")
Output:

Number is between 11-20
****************************************************************************************
Day 16:
Match Case Statements
To implement switch-case like characteristics very similar to if-else functionality, we use a match case in python. If you are coming from a C, C++ or Java like language, you must have heard of switch-case statements. If this is your first language, dont worry as I will tell you everything you need to know about match case statements in this video!

A match statement will compare a given variable’s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern. The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.

The match case consists of three main entities :

The match keyword
One or more case clauses
Expression for each case
The case clause consists of a pattern to be matched to the variable, a condition to be evaluated if the pattern matches, and a set of statements to be executed if the pattern matches.

Syntax:
match variable_name:
            case ‘pattern1’ : //statement1
            case ‘pattern2’ : //statement2
            …            
            case ‘pattern n’ : //statement n
Example:
x = 4
# x is the variable to match
match x:
    # if x is 0
    case 0:
        print("x is zero")
    # case with if-condition
    case 4 if x % 2 == 0:
        print("x % 2 == 0 and case is 4")
    # Empty case with if-condition
    case _ if x < 10:
        print("x is < 10")
    # default case(will only be matched if the above cases were not matched)
    # so it is basically just an else:
    case _:
        print(x)
Output:
x % 2 == 0 and case is 4
